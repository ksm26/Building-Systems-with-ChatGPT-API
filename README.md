Welcome to the "Building Systems With The ChatGPT API" course offered by DeepLearning.AI. Taught by Isa Fulford from OpenAI and Andrew Ng, this course will equip you with the knowledge and skills to automate complex workflows using chain calls to a large language model. By leveraging the ChatGPT API, you'll unlock new development capabilities and significantly enhance your efficiency.

## Course Description
"Building Systems With The ChatGPT API" introduces you to the techniques and strategies required to automate workflows and build powerful systems using the ChatGPT API. Throughout this course, you will:

- Create chains of prompts that interact with prior completions.
- Build systems where Python code interacts with completions and new prompts.
- Develop a customer service chatbot utilizing the skills learned in this course.

Furthermore, you'll learn how to apply these skills to practical scenarios, such as classifying user queries, evaluating query safety, and performing multi-step reasoning for various tasks. This one-hour course builds upon the lessons taught in the popular "ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers," although it does not require it as a prerequisite.

The course materials feature hands-on examples that make each concept easy to understand. You'll have the opportunity to experiment with the code and prompts presented in the course using the built-in Jupyter notebooks, ensuring a seamless learning experience.
